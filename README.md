This is my CV website. Pages are served from a Node server.


## Getting Started

If you want to download it and see how it works,  you can simply clone the repository and install the dependencies.
This is how to do it:

### Install node and npm

You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).
To get the tools we depend upon `npm`, the node package manager.
You can then simply do from the root of the project:

```
npm install
```

### Run the Application

The simplest way to start the project is;

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:3000`.
